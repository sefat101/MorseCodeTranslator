# MorseCodeTranslator
The Morse Code Translator is a Java console-based application that can convert text into Morse code and vice versa. Users can input text, and the program will translate it into Morse code characters. Similarly, users can input Morse code, and the program will translate it back into readable text.

Features
Text to Morse Code Conversion: Allow users to input text and convert it into Morse code characters. Provides a dictionary or mapping of letters, numbers, and spaces to their corresponding Morse code representations.

Morse Code to Text Conversion: Enable users to input Morse code and convert it into readable text. Reverses the process by looking up Morse code characters in the dictionary and finding their corresponding letters.

Support for Letters, Numbers, and Spaces: Ensure that the program supports translating individual letters, numbers, and spaces between words.

User Interaction: Present a user-friendly menu with options for converting text to Morse code, converting Morse code to text, and exiting the program.

Error Handling: Handle situations where users provide invalid inputs, such as non-alphabet characters or Morse code symbols that are not recognized.
